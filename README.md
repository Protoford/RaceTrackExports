# RaceTrackExports
Exported racetracks and courses created from https://github.com/emtneutrino/races 
To add each trackname to your server, go to a live console and type **`races import myrace`**, with the exact **`myrace`**.
Each **`myrace`** must not already be in your game, would have to be renamed and added with the new name, or delete the old one in game first, then import.
